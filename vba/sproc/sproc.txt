MSAccess < 2000 cannot access stored procedures directly
Therefore, the technique is to updatea temp table and
have the temp table trigger the stored procedure

In this example, the Routines will contain an update to _tmpUpdatePoll table
The dbo.tmpUpdatePoll table has the Trigger_FinalPolls_Update script
All output is placed into the SMG_Export_XML table which is either:
1. POST to API in order to drop into FTP site
2. Saved into a UNC path (linked to FTP site)
Then the respective APIs are called which read from the FTP site

table dbo.SMG_Export_XML
id      int
polls   varchar(max)
ballots varchar(max)

table dbo.SMG_School_Map
OldSchoolCode   varchar
NewSchoolCode   varchar
SchoolName      varchar
NCAAF           varchar
NCAAB           varchar
NCAAWB          varchar
CWS             varchar
