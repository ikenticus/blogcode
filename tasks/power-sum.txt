Find the number of ways that a given integer, X, can be expressed as the sum of the Nth powers of unique, natural numbers.

For example, if X = 13 and N = 2, we have to find all combinations of unique squares adding up to 13. The only solution is 2^2 + 3^2.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer X. 
The second line contains an integer N.

Constraints

  1 <= X <= 1000
  2 <= N <= 10

Output Format

Output a single integer, the number of possible combinations caclulated.

Sample Input 0

10
2

Sample Output 0

1

Explanation 0

If X = 10 and N = 2, we need to find the number of ways that 10 can be represented as the sum of squares of unique numbers.

10 = 1^2 + 3^2

This is the only way in which 10 can be expressed as the sum of unique squares.

Sample Input 1

100
2

Sample Output 1

3

Explanation 1

100 = 10^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 1^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 7^2

Sample Input 2

100
3

Sample Output 2

1

Explanation 2

100 can be expressed as the sum of the cubes of 1, 2, 3, 4. 
(1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100). There is no other way to express 100 as the sum of cubes.
