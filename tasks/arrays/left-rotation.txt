Check out the resources on the page's right side to learn more about arrays. The video tutorial is by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, author of the best-selling interview book Cracking the Coding Interview.

A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then the array would become [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].

Given an array a of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

Function Description

Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below. It should return the resulting array of integers.

rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

* An array of integers a.
* An integer d, the number of rotations.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and d, the size of a and the number of left rotations you must perform. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers a[i].

Constraints

  1 <= n <= 10^5
  1 <= d <= n
  1 <= a[i] <= 10^6

Output Format

Print a single line of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d left rotations.

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4

Explanation

When we perform d = 4 left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 1] -> [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] -> [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] -> [5, 1, 2 , 3, 4]
