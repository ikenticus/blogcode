Objective 

Today, we're learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called Recursion. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial 

    factorial(N) = { 1                      N <= 1
                   { N x factorial(N-1)     otherwise

Task 

Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, N as a parameter and prints the result of N!(N factorial).

Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

Input Format

A single integer, N (the argument to pass to factorial).

Constraints

  2 <= N <= 12
* Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting N!.

Sample Input

3

Sample Output

6

Explanation

Consider the following steps:

 1. factorial(3) = 3 x factorial(2)
 2. factorial(2) = 2 x factorial(1)
 3. factorial(1) = 1

From steps 2 and 3, we can say factorial(2) = 2 x 1 = 2; then when we apply the value from factorial(2) to step 1, we get factorial(3) = 3 x 2 x 1. Thus, we print 6 as our answer.
