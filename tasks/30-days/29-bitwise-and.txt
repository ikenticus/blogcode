Objective 

Welcome to the last day! Today, we're discussing bitwise operations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 

Given set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., N}. Find two integers, A and B (where iA < B), from set S such that the value of A & B is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, K. In this case, & represents the bitwise AND operator.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases. 
Each of the T subsequent lines defines a test case as 2 space-separated integers, N and K, respectively.

Constraints

  1 <= T <= 10^3
  2 <= N <= 10^3
  2 <= K <= N

Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum possible value of A & B on a new line.

Sample Input

3
5 2
8 5
2 2

Sample Output

1
4
0

Explanation

N = 5, K = 2, S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 

All possible values of A and B are:

 1. A = 1, B = 2; A & B = 0
 2. A = 1, B = 3; A & B = 1
 3. A = 1, B = 4; A & B = 0
 4. A = 1, B = 5; A & B = 1
 5. A = 2, B = 3; A & B = 2
 6. A = 2, B = 4; A & B = 0
 7. A = 2, B = 5; A & B = 0
 8. A = 3, B = 4; A & B = 0
 9. A = 3, B = 5; A & B = 1
10. A = 4, B = 5; A & B = 4

The maximum possible value of A & B that is also < (K = 2) is 1, so we print 1 on a new line.
