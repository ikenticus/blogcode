Objective 

Today, we're getting started with Exceptions by learning how to parse an integer from a string and print a custom error message. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 
Read a string, S, and print its integer value; if S cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

Note: You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling constructs built into your submission language. If you attempt to use loops/conditional statements, you will get a 0 score.

Input Format

A single string, S.

Constraints

  1 <= |S| <= 6, where |S| is the length of string S.
* S is composed of either lowercase letters (a - z) or decimal digits (0 - 9).

Output Format

Print the parsed integer value of S, or Bad String if S cannot be converted to an integer.

Sample Input 0

3

Sample Output 0

3

Sample Input 1

za

Sample Output 1

Bad String

Explanation

Sample Case 0 contains an integer, so it should not raise an exception when we attempt to convert it to an integer. Thus, we print the 3. 
Sample Case 1 does not contain any integers, so an attempt to convert it to an integer will raise an exception. Thus, our exception handler prints Bad String.
