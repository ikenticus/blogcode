Objective 

Today's challenge puts your understanding of nested conditional statements to the test. You already have the knowledge to complete this challenge, but check out the Tutorial tab for a video on testing!

Task 

Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).
2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine = 15 Hackos x (the number of days late).
3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = 500 Hackos x (the number of months late).
4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 Hackos.

Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book was actually returned. 
The second line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).

Constraints

  1 <= D <= 31
  1 <= M <= 12
  1 <= Y <= 3000
* It is guaranteed that the dates will be valid Gregorian calendar dates.

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.

Sample Input

9 6 2015
6 6 2015

Sample Output

45

Explanation

Given the following return dates: 

Actual:   Da = 9, Ma = 6, Ya = 2015
Expected: De = 6, Me = 6, Ye = 2015
Because Ye === Ya, we know it is less than a year late. 
Because Me === Ma, we know it's less than a month late. 
Because De < Da, we know that it was returned late (but still within the same month and year).

Per the library's fee structure, we know that our fine will be 15 Hackos x (# days late).
We then print the result of 15 x (Da - De) = 15 x (9 - 6) = 45 as our output.
